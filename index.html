        <h2 class="iceland">Places to Visit</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Silfra</li>
            <li>Skaftafell Ice Caves</li>
            <li>Kirkjufell</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="iceland">Silfra</h3>

        <img src="http://magmadive.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Silfra-Hall.jpg" alt="water between continental plates" width="250">
        <br>
        <p>Touch the edges of the Eurasian and North American plate <em>at the same time</em> when diving in the clear waters of Silfra. The water, being almost completely transparent, refracts light in a similar manner that crystals do. The stunning landscape is composed of lava rock, sand, and algae and attracts snorklers from all over the world. Silfra can be enjoyed all year, whether it is summer or winter. Either way, the waters of the rift can reach <strong>2° Celsius</strong> so make sure to bring a jacket!</p>

        <h3 class="iceland">Skaftafell Ice Caves</h3>

        <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/ice-caves-in-iceland-picture-id508581170?k=6&m=508581170&s=612x612&w=0&h=FkXWjLq_LVer-yu9PmlU71BWpUnxdEi1XICaR6odpkE=" alt="lakebed inside ice cave" width="250">
        <br>
        <p>Visible after rain has fallen in winter, the Skaftafell ice caves are composed of highly pressurized glacier ice that is centuries old. The caves are created in glaciers, which means they are not fixed structures. Winter is the best time to visit since the ice of the caves may not be hard enough in any other season. The most famous of the ice caves is the Crystal Ice Cave, known for its turquoise, aquamarine, and quartz-like structures. Visit the Skaftafell Ice Caves quickly because the <strong>increasing global temperature</strong> is melting these caverns. </p>

        <h3 class="iceland">Kirkjufell</h3>

        <img src="https://www.btitravel.is/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kirkjufell-mountain.jpg" alt="sunset over Kirkjufell mountains and waterfall" width="250">
        <br>
        <p>Named for its likeness to the shape of a church steeple, Kirkjufell is an attraction that maintains its beauty all year. One can find the <strong>northern lights</strong> and <strong>midnight sun</strong> at Kirkjufell, which can only be found in certain places. You might recognize Kirkjufell because a scene from <em>Game of Thrones</em> was taken here. Make sure to bring your cameras because this scenery is instagram quality!</p>

        <br>
        <p>In this game of Fox and Geese, one player uses 15 white pieces, which represent geese, while the other player uses 1 red or black piece, which represent the fox. The objective of the geese is to capture the fox, but can only do so by moving sideways, diagonally forward, or straight forward. The fox must evade immobilization by capturing at least 13 geese. An even number of rounds are played, and whoever wins the most rounds is the one who wins the game. <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nDMQ5yvsFlw/V7X3vObqbII/AAAAAAAACho/kgMovyLXNxYREz9NoDr_BQocpoIQEZ-SgCLcB/s1600/quadrati_triangoli.jpg">Print out a board and play at home by clicking here.</a></p>
